# Printed Text to Speech Converter
This project aims to assist visually impaired individuals in accessing printed resources easily by converting printed text to speech. We have developed a model that leverages the powerful OCR capabilities of PyTesseract to recognize printed text and the text-to-speech functionalities of pyttsx3 to vocalize the recognized text.

## Features
* Optical Character Recognition (OCR): Uses PyTesseract to accurately recognize and extract text from printed materials.
* Text-to-Speech Conversion: Utilizes pyttsx3 to convert the recognized text into natural-sounding speech.
* User-Friendly: Designed with simplicity and accessibility in mind to make the learning process easier for blind individuals.
